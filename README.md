Alien Phoenix is a GUI and gaming framework for the Monkey 2 programing language. It includes a GUI that is game oriented, customizable, fast and efficient. The GUI offers multiple windows that are independent and work within a Monkey 2 canvas. Alien Phoenix also includes mapping, physics and other integrated code to assist in game development. This framework is part of the Phoenix USC game project currently in development.

Alien Phoenix is currently in early development. While in this state you should be aware that features, syntax and architecture will change over time until the project reaches a stable release state. As such all code should be treated as in flux and subject to change. <b>While in early development this frameworks code will be available in the 'Dev branch'</b>.
